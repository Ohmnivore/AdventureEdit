# AdventureEdit
AdventureEdit is a 2D sprite-based editor I'm writing for a game I'm working on. The game in question doesn't use tiles,
just sprites, so I tried the GLEE2D editor. Unfortunately it generates very bulky XML files, and lacks something akin to
Ogmo's entity system. To me, AdventureEdit is a clone of Ogmo Editor (in terms of functionality) adapted to sprite-based games.

# Should you use this?
Uhm, no. I'm not done implementing all the planned features yet. That should be done by the middle of March. However,
I'll return to working on my game as soon as I'm done implementing the features. This means that the editor will be left
in an extremely unpolished state (i.e. buggy, with ugly and sometimes non-intuitive UI). I can't say for sure when I'll
start polishing this project, but it will only be in a few months.
